The current view of Wikipedia on browser is very eye-straining. So I thought why not make it look minimalistic?
So I made this app from scratch. WikiLite is made wth React.js & Tailwind CSS. Wikilite utilizes public Wikipedia API to fetch data from Wiki and presents it on the viewport. Nowadays, due to COVID19 crisis, we, specially students like me, are doing our studies from home, to be honest if we get stuck at any point, we prefer Wikipedia. But when we try to surf any article or question/answer on Wikipedia, the default theme look is not very suitable for going through & moreover makes us feel bored. So, Wikilite is the perfect solution for Wikipedia for mobile users. This app is still in development as I will be making this React app into a React-SPWA. Wikilite is hosted on Netlify for now. Fork my repo & free to drop a star if you ❤️ it :)
